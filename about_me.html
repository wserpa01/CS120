            <h2>Tales of Travel:</h2>
        </div>

        <p>
            I enjoy traveling when given the opportunity. Recently, a few friends and I took a trip to Peorio, Arizona.
            This Trip was a Tuesday to Tuesday vacation where we rented an Airbnb. We are currently planning a trip to 
            Fort Meyers, Florida for this upcomming summer!

            My favorite pet names originate to pets I've either had or currently have. They are listed below! 
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>A dog named Chloe</li>
            <li>A cat named Taz</li>
            <li>A cat named Black Cat</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>Favorite Resturant:</h2>
        </div>

        <div>My favorite resturant is called <a href="https://www.turksseafood.com" target="_blank"> Turks Seafood</a>.</div>
        
        <p>
            It is a resturant that serves primarily fish based recipies. 
            Their Sushi is prepared fresh and they also have larger meals available.
            It is typically very busy, however it is worth the wait. They have outdoor seating options,
            indoor seating options, and a sushi bar seating option where you can watch the chef prepare the sushi.
            If you're ever in Southern Massachusetts, I would strongly recommend checking if you can stop by and try it out.

            <h2>Favorite Food:</h2>
        </div>

        <img src='.\Images\FavoriteFood.jpg' align='left' height="300" hspace="15">

        <p>
            Contrary to my favorite restaurant, my favorite food is a forward-seared steak served 
            on mashed potatoes. I like the steak cooked medium rare with a well-seared crust. I 
            usually eat the potatoes and steak together, one piece at a time. Sometimes I include 
            a vegetable like asparagus or green beans, but I typically eat those first. Not because 
            they're my favorite, but because I get them out of the way before enjoying the best part.

            <h3>How I like to prep the steak:</h3>
        </div>

        <p>
            First, you set your stove to high heat and heat a cast iron skillet. Use a high smoke point oil and create a think layer on the pan.
            Allow the pan to heat. You can flick a small amount of water into the oil to check temperature. If the water evaporates instantly, it is hot enough.
            Take your steak (Seasoned + Rested at room temperature for 30 minutes) and lay into the pan away from your body. Sear on each side and edges.
            Once seared, insert a temperature probe set to 130 degrees Fahrenheit and place the pan and steak into a pre-heated oven set at 375 degrees.
            Cook until at temperature, remove from the over and let it rest to finish cooking. Plate along with garlick mashed potatoes and enjoy.

            <h2>Reading Habits:</h2>
        </div>

        <p>
            I enjoy reading, however I don't read all the time. Sometimes, I will read a lot in a short period
            of time, and then not read for a while. I have a habit of exhausting a hobby which causes burnout.
            I've included some of my all time favorite books. Why are they my favorite? To be quite honest,
            I'm not sure! These books resonated with me at time when I read them, which helped them find a place
            in my list of favorites.
